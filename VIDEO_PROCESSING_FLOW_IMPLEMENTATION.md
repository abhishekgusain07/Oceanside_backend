# Video Processing Flow Implementation - Complete

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Issue**: After recording stopped and chunks were uploaded to R2, no Celery task was triggered for video processing.

**Root Cause**: The `recording_stopped` SocketIO event only emitted `stop-rec` to clients but didn't trigger the video processing pipeline.

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced SocketIO Recording Stop Handler
**File**: `backend/app/api/simple_socketio.py`

**Changes**:
- Modified `recording_stopped` event to trigger Celery task
- Added database validation before processing
- Added client notifications for processing status
- Comprehensive error handling with specific error messages

**New Flow**:
```
Frontend stops recording → SocketIO recording_stopped event → 
Update DB status to "processing" → Trigger Celery task → 
Notify clients of processing start
```

### 2. Enhanced Recording Service 
**File**: `backend/app/services/recording_service.py`

**Added Methods**:
- `trigger_video_processing()` - Validates recording state and triggers Celery task
- `mark_recording_failed()` - Handles processing failures with error details

**Features**:
- Recording state validation (only process CREATED/ACTIVE recordings)
- Processing attempt tracking
- Proper error handling and rollback

### 3. Enhanced Video Processing Task
**File**: `backend/app/tasks/video_processing.py`

**Improvements**:
- Added SocketIO notifications for processing completion/failure
- Better error handling with client notifications
- Maintained existing R2 download → process → upload → cleanup flow

### 4. New SocketIO Events for Processing Status
**File**: `backend/app/api/simple_socketio.py`

**New Events**:
- `video-processing-started` - Emitted when processing begins
- `video-processing-update` - Emitted during processing (completion/failure)
- `video-processing-error` - Emitted on processing errors
- `request_processing_status` - Allows clients to query processing status
- `processing-status-response` - Response with current processing status

## 🔄 Complete End-to-End Flow

### Recording Phase
1. **User starts recording** → Frontend captures video chunks
2. **Chunks uploaded** → Each chunk goes to R2 via presigned URLs
3. **Upload confirmations** → Backend verifies each chunk upload

### Processing Phase  
4. **User stops recording** → Frontend emits `recording_stopped` 
5. **SocketIO handler** → Updates DB status to "processing" + triggers Celery task
6. **Celery worker** → Downloads chunks from R2 → Concatenates → Processes → Uploads final video
7. **Processing complete** → Updates DB status to "completed" + notifies clients
8. **Cleanup** → Removes original chunks from R2

### Error Handling
- **Database errors** → Proper rollback and error reporting
- **R2 errors** → Detailed error messages and retry logic  
- **Processing failures** → Mark recording as failed + notify clients
- **Celery failures** → Task retry with exponential backoff

## 🛠️ Testing & Setup

### Prerequisites
1. **Redis running**: `redis-server` or Docker
2. **Celery worker**: `celery -A app.core.celery_app worker --loglevel=info`
3. **R2 CORS configured**: Chunks can upload successfully
4. **FFmpeg installed**: For video processing

### Test Script
Run `python backend/test_celery_setup.py` to verify:
- Redis connection
- Celery app configuration  
- Video processing task registration
- Database connectivity
- R2 storage access

### Manual Testing Flow
1. Start recording in frontend
2. Let it record for ~15-30 seconds  
3. Stop recording
4. Check backend logs for:
   ```
   🎬 Triggering video processing for recording {room_id}
   🎬 Video processing task queued with ID: {task_id}
   ```
5. Check Celery worker logs for processing progress
6. Verify final video appears in R2 bucket under `riverside/processed/{room_id}/`
